# ðŸš€ The Ultimate Quant Prep Roadmap (Easy to Hard)

This guide provides a structured path to prepare for the technical interviews and tests at elite quantitative trading firms. It is organized by topic, with resources listed in a suggested order of completion to build your knowledge progressively.

---

### **The Grand Strategy: A Phased Approach**

Your preparation will follow a clear, three-phase sequence.

* **Phase 1: Foundational Theory (The Bedrock)**
    * First, build a solid, intuitive understanding of the core mathematical and algorithmic theory. This provides the tools for everything that follows.

* **Phase 2: Parallelized Practice & Application (The Grind)**
    * This is where you will spend the majority of your time. You will tackle Math Puzzles, Competitive Programming, Mental Math, and Market Making in parallel, as skills in one area will reinforce the others.

* **Phase 3: Specializations (The Optional Edge)**
    * Lastly, and only if required by your background or specific role, you will cover Machine Learning and Finance.

## Detailed Topic Breakdown

Here are the key subjects, organized from foundational to advanced.

### **1. Mathematical Theory Fundamentals**

**Goal:** Develop a robust, first-principles understanding of probability and linear algebra. Do not just memorize formulas; know *why* they work.

#### **A. Probability & Statistics**
* **Foundational (Building Intuition):**
    * **Resource:** [**Harvard Stat 110 Lectures by Joe Blitzstein**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/%40galencolin) (on YouTube)
        * **Why:** The single best resource for building a deep, intuitive understanding of probability from the ground up.
* **Core Textbook (Building Rigor):**
    * **Resource:** **"A First Course in Probability" by Sheldon Ross** or the recommended IITD textbook for MTL106.
        * **Why:** A standard university textbook that will give you a formal, rigorous understanding of the subject. Key chapters to cover include:
            * Combinatorial Analysis
            * Axioms of Probability (including Bayes' Theorem)
            * Discrete & Continuous Random Variables
            * Expectation & Variance
            * Important Distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Uniform, Normal, Exponential)
            * Markov Chains & Stochastic Processes

#### **B. Linear Algebra**

    * **Resource:** [**3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra"**](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanielNaroditsky0) (on YouTube)
        * **Why:** Watch this *before* opening any textbook. It provides the geometric intuition behind the operations.
* **Core Textbook (Building Rigor):**
    * **Resource:** **"Introduction to Linear Algebra" by Gilbert Strang** (and his accompanying [**MIT OCW Lectures**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)).
        * **Why:** The standard text for a reason. Focus on understanding vector spaces, subspaces, linear independence, and everything related to **eigenvalues and eigenvectors**.

### **2. Algorithms Fundamentals**

**Goal:** Learn the standard library of algorithms and data structures used in problem-solving. Develop an intuition for time and space complexity.

* **Core Textbook:**
    * **Resource:** [**"Competitive Programmer's Handbook"**](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) by Antti Laaksonen
        * **Why:** A concise and modern guide to all relevant topics for competitive programming and technical interviews. For fundamentals, cover these sections first:
            * **Part I (Basic Techniques):** Chapters 1-11. This covers Time Complexity, Sorting, Data Structures (STL), Greedy Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming.
            * **Part II (Graph Algorithms):** Chapters 12-16. This covers BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, and MSTs.
* **Implementation Reference:**
    * **Resource:** [**CP-Algorithms**](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
        * **Why:** An excellent, detailed reference for a wide variety of algorithms with clean implementations. Use this when the handbook feels too brief on a specific topic.
